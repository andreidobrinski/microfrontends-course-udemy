# Microfrontends Notes

## What is a microfrontend?

- Splitting a monolithic application's frontend into multiple different codebases
- Usually split depending on major features
- Each codebase can have it's own SPA implementation/frontend framework
- Try to prevent direct communication between frontends
- Use an API to manage communication between SPAs

Smaller apps:

- easier to understand
- easier to make changes to
- easier for separate teams to work on
